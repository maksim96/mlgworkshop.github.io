      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> We present HARP, a novel method for learning low dimensional embeddings of a graph's nodes which preserves higher-order structural features. Our proposed method achieves this by compressing the input graph prior to embedding it, effectively avoiding troublesome embedding configurations (i.e. local minima) which can pose problems to non-convex optimization.\n",
      "HARP works by finding a smaller graph which approximates the global structure of its input. This simplified graph is used to learn a set of initial representations, which serve as good initializations for learning representations in the original, detailed graph. We inductively extend this idea, by decomposing a graph in a series of levels, and then embed the hierarchy of graphs from the coarsest one to the original graph. \n",
      "HARP is a general meta-strategy to improve all of the state-of-the-art neural algorithms for embedding graphs, including DeepWalk, LINE, and Node2vec. Indeed, we demonstrate that applying HARP's hierarchical paradigm yields improved implementations for all three of these methods, as evaluated on both classification tasks on real-world graphs such as DBLP, BlogCatalog, CiteSeer, and Arxiv, where we achieve a performance gain over the original implementations by up to 14% Macro F1.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language Processing (NLP). They provide compact representations that encapsulate word similarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic tasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of research into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is graph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that encapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge prediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph based tasks, embeddings have been learned in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces.\n",
      "However, recent work has shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks is not the flat Euclidean space, but negatively curved, hyperbolic space. We present a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning neural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental evidence that embedding graphs in their natural geometry significantly improves performance on downstream tasks for several real-world public datasets.\n",

To simplify experimental design and analysis in these environments, simple assumptions are made about the behavior of its members. However, nodes may not respond to treatment, or may respond maliciously. These adversarial nodes influence treatment topology by preventing or altering the expected network effect, but may not be known or detectable.  We characterize the influence of adversarial nodes and the bias these nodes introduce in average treatment effect estimates.\n",

In addition to theoretical bounds, we  empirically demonstrate estimation bias through experiments on synthetically generated networks. We consider both the case in which adversarial nodes are dispersed randomly through the network and the case where adversarial node placement is targeted to the highest degree nodes. Our work demonstrates that peer influence makes causal estimates on networks susceptible to the actions of adversaries, and specific network structures are particularly vulnerable to to adversarial responses.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> For any stream of time-stamped edges that form a dynamic network, an important choice is the aggregation granularity that an analyst uses to bin the data.  Picking such a windowing of the data is often done by hand, or left up to the technology that is collecting the data.  However, the choice can make a big difference in the properties of the dynamic network.  Finding a good windowing is the time scale detection problem.  In previous work, this problem is often solved with an unsupervised heuristic.  As an unsupervised problem, it is difficult to measure how well a given windowing algorithm performs.  \n",

      "Given this, in accordance with standard supervised machine learning practices, we introduce new windowing algorithms that automatically adapt to the task the analyst wants to perform by treating windowing as a hyperparameter for the task, rather than using heuristics.  This approach measures the quality of the windowing by how well a given task is accomplished on the resulting network.  This also allows us, for the first time, to directly compare different windowing algorithms to each other, by comparing how well the task is accomplished using that windowing algorithm.  We compare this approach to previous approaches and several baselines on real data.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Discovering the underlying structures present in large real world graphs is a fundamental scientific problem. Recent work at the intersection of formal language theory and graph theory has found that a Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (HRG) can be extracted from a tree decomposition of any graph. This HRG can be used to generate new graphs that share properties that are similar to the original graph. Because the extracted HRG is directly dependent on the shape and contents of the of tree decomposition, it is unlikely that informative graph-processes are actually being captured with the extraction algorithm. To address this problem, the current work presents a new extraction algorithm called temporal HRG (tHRG) that learns HRG production rules from a temporal tree decomposition of the graph. We observe problems with the assumptions that are made in a temporal HRG model. In experiments on large real world networks, we show and provide reasoning as to why tHRG does not perform as well as HRG and other graph generators.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Star sampling (SS) is a graph search mechanism wherein each sample consists of a vertex (the star center) and its one-hop neighbors (the star points).  We consider the use of star sampling to find any vertex in a specified target set in a large graph, where the figure of merit is the expected number of samples until a vertex in the target set is encountered, either as a star center or as a star point.  We analyze this performance measure on three related star sampling paradigms: SS with replacement (SS-R), SS without center replacement (SS-C), and SS without star replacement (SS-S).  Exact expressions for the average number of samples under SS-R and SS-C are easily obtained.  Much of the paper is focused on deriving an approximate expression for the performance of SS-S.  Experiments are run on both \"synthetic\" graphs, i.e., Erdos-Renyi (ER) graphs, as well as three \"real-world\" graphs.  The two contributions of the paper are: i) the analytical approximation for SS-S is seen to be quite accurate for both types of graphs, ii) we observe, perhaps surprisingly, there is little performance difference across the three sampling paradigms.  This performance insensitivity of SS-R relative to SS-S may be understood as the result of two competing factors: removing stars reduces the number of vertices outside the target set, but also removes the number of neighbors of the target set.\n",

Given a knowledge graph G, it is to discover top-k diversified reduced summaries with maximized quality in terms of both informativeness and diversity. (3) We show that diversified summarization is feasible for large knowledge graphs,  by developing a parallel approximation algorithm with quality guarantees. We show that the algorithm is parallel scalable, which ensures the feasibility of summarization in large graphs. Using real-world graphs, we experimentally verify the efficiency of our parallel summarization algorithms, and query evaluation guided by summarization. \n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> The problem of predicting unobserved entries of a partially observed matrix has found wide applicability in several areas, such as recommender systems, computational biology, and computer vision. Many scalable methods with rigorous theoretical guarantees have been developed for algorithms where the matrix is factored into low-rank components, and embeddings are learned for the row and column variables. While there has been recent research on incorporating explicit side information in the low-rank matrix factorization setting, often implicit information can be gleaned from the data, via higher order interactions among variables. In this paper, we design a method to make use of this implicit information, via random walks on graphs. We show that the problem we intend to solve can be cast as factoring a nonlinear transform of the (partially) observed matrix and develop an efficient coordinate descent based algorithm for the same. Experiments on several datasets show that the method we propose outperforms vanilla matrix factorization, and also those methods that use explicitly available side information.\n",

These challenges cannot be addressed by standard supervised machine learning approaches. We highlight the fact that the current applications of machine learning for cybersecurity have focused on feature based learning and largely ignored identifying and learning from the underlying relationships between malware samples.

While the emphasis of the related literature has been on detecting events without considering geography information, this work regards an event as something occurring at a particular location and time. We take a system perspective, focusing on the process of event detection using a framework that highlights different steps needed for identifying events in this noisy domain. We also propose an algorithm which leverages geotagged bursty term graphs to detect events from a tweet stream.  Evaluating our approach on three large tweet streams from three different domains shows our approach significantly improves the detection precision and recall when compared to the state of the art approaches.

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Fraud detection is facing more challenges when online fraudsters invest more resources, including purchasing large pools of fake user accounts and dedicated IPs, to make their attacks less obvious. Existing approaches such as average degree maximization in adjacency matrices or tensors, that aimed at finding the connections of maximum average degree density suffer from the bias of including more false positive nodes, resulting in lower accuracy and increased need for manual verification. Therefore, we propose HoloScope method to detect topology and spike suspiciousness simultaneously. A novel \"contrast suspiciousness\" is introduced for honoring contrast behaviors between fraudsters and normal users. In terms of graph topology, it allows us to more accurately detect fraudulent blocks, reducing the false positive nodes; In terms of temporal spikes, HoloScope takes into account the bursts caused by fraudsters' attacking, and the sudden drops due to the poor attractiveness of fake objects. In addition, we provide theoretical bounds for how much this increases the time cost needed for fraudsters to conduct adversarial attacks. Additionally, from the perspective of ratings, HoloScope incorporates the deviation of rating scores in order to catch fraudsters more accurately. Moreover, the HoloScope has a concise framework and sub-quadratic time complexity, which make our algorithm reproducible and scalable. In the experiments, HoloScope achieved significant accuracy improvements on both synthetic and real data, compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Several 'edge-discovery' applications over graph-based data models are known to have worst-case quadratic time complexity in the nodes, even if the discovered edges are sparse. One example is the generic link discovery problem between two graphs, which has invited research interest in several communities. Specific versions of this problem include link prediction in social networks, ontology alignment  between metadata-rich RDF data, approximate joins, and entity resolution between instance-rich data. As large datasets continue to proliferate, reducing quadratic complexity to make the task practical is an important research problem. Within the entity resolution community, the problem is commonly referred to as blocking. A particular class of learnable blocking schemes is known as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) blocking schemes, and has emerged as state-of-the art for homogeneous (i.e. same-schema) tabular data. Despite the promise of these schemes, a formalism or learning framework has not been developed for them when input data instances are generic, attributed graphs possessing both node and edge heterogeneity. With such a development, the complexity-reducing scope of DNF schemes becomes applicable to a variety of problems, including entity resolution and type alignment between heterogeneous graphs, and link prediction in networks represented as attributed graphs. This paper presents a graph-theoretic formalism for DNF schemes, and investigates their learnability in an optimization framework. We also briefly describe an empirical case study encapsulating some of the principles in this paper.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> Finding a group of experts is a natural way to perform a collection of tasks that needs a set of diversified skills.  This can be done by assigning skills to different experts with complementary expertise.  This allows organizations and big institutes to efficiently hire a group of experts with different skill sets to deliver a series of required tasks in order to finish a set of projects.  We are given a collection of projects, in which each of them needs a set of required skills.  Performing each project brings a profit to the organization.  We are also given a set of experts, each of them are equipped with a set of skills.  In order to hire an expert, the organization should provide her monetary cost (i.e., salary).  Furthermore, we are given a certain amount of budget to hire experts.  The goal is to hire a group of experts within the given budget to perform a subset of projects that maximizes the total profit.  This problem is called Cluster Hire and was introduced recently.   In this paper, we extend this problem by making the realistic assumption that there exist an underlying network among experts.  This network is built based on past collaboration among experts.  If two experts have past collaboration, they form a more collaborative and efficient team in the future.  In addition of maximizing the total profit, we are also interested to find the most collaborative group of experts by minimizing the communication cost between them.  We propose two greedy algorithms with different strategies to solve this problem.  Extensive experiments on real dataset show our proposed algorithms are able to find a group of experts that cover projects with high profit while experts are able to communicate with each other efficiently.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> The diffusion of a contagion (e.g. news, meme, virus) is a common event in  (online and offline) social networks. Unfortunately, such networks, known as diffusion networks, are often unknown: that is, one can observe when subjects are infected by a given contagion (e.g., when a piece of information arrives, when a product is adopted, when a virus is caught), but does not know through which connection the infection has been transmitted. The goal of this study is to infer such networks based on nodes infection contexts associated to diffusion events (cascades). Previous studies mostly relied on delay patterns between infection events of nodes to infer edges. It has been argued, however, that delay-agnostic approaches are also efficient for such inference. Motivated by this finding, we present a novel delay-agnostic algorithm that is largely inspired by representation learning of words in documents and nodes in networks. Moreover, unlike some delay-agnostic methods, we only consider infection context of nodes in a restricted window. After empirically observing a similarity between the distribution of words in documents and nodes in cascades, we employ the Skip-Gram model to learn a representation of nodes from cascades. The learned representation is then used to compute the probability that an edge exists between a pair of nodes. Through extensive experiments we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, showing that it is able to recover up to ~95% of the hidden network in realistic datasets. We have also compared our algorithm to the state-of-the-art algorithm InfoPath, and achieved a large improvement on the quality of results.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper studies the problem of learning large-scale graph representations (a.k.a. embeddings). Such representations encode the relations among distinct nodes on the continuous feature space. The learned representations generalize over various tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and recommendation. Learning nodes representations aims to map proximate nodes close to one another in the low-dimension vector space. Thus, embedding algorithms pursue to preserve local and global network structure by identifying nodes neighborhood notions. However, the means proposed methods have been employed in order to identify nodes neighborhoods fail to precisely capture network structure. In this paper, we propose a novel scalable graph embedding algorithmic framework called GECS, which aims to learn graph representations using connection subgraphs, where analogy with electrical circuits has been employed. The connection subgraphs are created to address the proximity among each two non-adjacent nodes, which are abundant in real-world networks, by maximizing the amount of flow between them. Although a subgraph captures proximity between two non-adjacent nodes, the formation of the subgraph addresses the direct connections with immediate neighbors as well. Therefore, our algorithm better preserves the local and global structure of a network. Further, despite the fact that non-adjacent nodes are numerous in real-world networks, our algorithm can scale to large-scale graphs, because we do not deal with the graph as a whole, instead, with much more smaller extracted subgraphs.\n",
