      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Matrix factorization is a central block in many graph algorithms for embedding, clustering and many other tasks. This block is usually the computational bottleneck of these algorithms and a naive implementation can prevent them from scaling to large datasets. However, the matrices to factorize often have a closed-form \"sparse~+~low rank\" structure. In this paper, we show how to adapt state-of-the-art matrix factorization techniques to this class of matrices. We demonstrate that the method is highly competitive with respect to the naive implementation and that it comes at a very small extra cost compared to the decomposition of the sparse component alone.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Competitive Influence Maximization (CIM) problem studies the competition among multiple parties where each party aims to maximize their profit while competing against other parties. Recently, Reinforcement-Learning based models have been proposed to address the CIM problem. However, such models are unscalable and incapable of handling changes in the network structure. Motivated by the recent success of Deep Reinforcement Learning models and their capability to handle complex problems, we propose a novel Deep Reinforcement learning based framework (DRIM) to address the multi-round competitive influence maximization problem. DRIM framework considers the community structure of the social network for budget allocation and feature extraction with deep Q network in order to reduce the computational time of seed selection. The proposed framework employs the quota-based ϵ-greedy policy to explore the optimality of influence maximization strategies and budget allocation for each community. Experimental results show that the proposed DRIM framework performs better than the state-of-art algorithms to tackle the multi-round CIM problem.\n",

To the best of our knowledge this is the first DeGroot-type opinion formation model that captures the Backfire Effect.

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Finding the dense region in a graph is a crucial problem in network analysis. Core decomposition and truss decomposition address this problem from two different perspectives. The core decomposition is a vertex-driven approach that gives each vertex a core number based on the degree, while the truss decomposition is an edge- driven approach that gives each edge a truss number based on the triangles count. Some previous works explored the common patterns in real-world networks through a vertex-driven approach. Our ongoing research aims to explore the pervasive patterns and anomalies in real-world networks from both the vertex and edge perspective. We introduce an analysis of truss decomposition and its relation to core decomposition in various types of real-world networks. We first investigate the characteristics of the core and truss degeneracy of real-world networks as well as random graphs and check how the clique counts relate to those properties. Then we analyze the interplay between core and truss decomposition by checking the truss numbers (and triangle counts) of edges with respect to the core numbers (and degrees) of their end points.\n",

For drawings in particular, we cannot rely on texture, color or shading information; there is little information present in a drawing beyond the spatial relationships and topology. A topological graph is an intuitive and powerful data structure and data representation framework that can capture the topological relations and spatial arrangement among entities present in images. In this paper, we use topological features automatically extracted from graph representations of images for image classification. Our approach is simple, intuitive, and generic. We compare our method against a traditional feature descriptor, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) on the MNIST data set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our graph approach, especially when applied to small sets of training data. In addition, our method is very fast to train, and also much less sensitive to hyperparameters, requiring little hyperparameter fine tuning.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Graphs are versatile data structures that have permeated a large number of application fields, such as biochemistry, knowledge graphs, and social networks. As a result, different graph representation learning models have been proposed as effective approaches to represent graph components in downstream machine learning tasks, such as node classification and recommendation. However, most representation learning models in graphs do not natively work on heterogeneous graphs and consequently are not able to learn embeddings for different relations in the graph. In this paper, we extend and improve existing models by enabling an edge-based transformation procedure in order to learn embeddings for different relations in heterogeneous graphs. In addition, we show that by incorporating a sequential model to learn more expressive representations, temporal dynamics in social networks can be captured. Finally, we examine our model within the context of two very disparate heterogeneous graphs, a knowledge graph dataset and a professional social network dataset, to illustrate our point and show the effectiveness of our approach. By learning edge-based transformations, our model yields a Mean Reciprocal Rank score that is more than 4 times higher than the homogeneous counterpart for the knowledge graph dataset. By incorporating the temporal dynamics, our model improves the HITS@1 score by more than 15% compared with the baseline model for the professional social network dataset.\n",

Our method incorporates the idea of node grouping into the design of the neural network. That way, unlike other methods that employ clustering as a pre-processing step to reorder nodes, GroupINN learns the node grouping and extracts graph features jointly.

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Graphs have emerged as powerful representations of data, from obvious examples such as social networks, to proximity graphs of high-dimensional metric data. Many of such real-world data sets share a common property: they have a well-hidden and much simpler graph-structured core, from which all data points emerge. Uncovering these core structures, in this paper termed backbones, often offers great insight into these data sets. However, standard methods for identifying these are computationally inefficient, sensitive to outliers, and lead to topological bias, prioritizing low-weight edges in dense regions, instead of spreading out smoothly across the topology underlying the graph. Furthermore, for high-dimensional metric data, standard methods for dimensionality reduction often fail to reveal the hidden topology. We resolve these issues by introducing the boundary coefficient (BC), a powerful vertex measure for locating core structure in data sets with an underlying graph-structured topology. Combining the BC with the newly proposed concept of f-pines, we propose a generally applicable method for revealing these structures in such data. We evaluate our method on a number of artificial and real-life data sets, demonstrating its wide range of applicability, superior effectiveness, robustness against noise, and scalability.\n",

Despite advances in automated cyberattack sensors, many attacks are still detected many days or months after they occur. We propose a new approach using statistical relational learning to fuse cyberattack sensor outputs and generate attack predictions. Leveraging the graphical structures of both sensor outputs and cyberattack events themselves, we achieve higher accuracy than individual sensors by reasoning collectively over both sensors and attacks. Our predictions also are more useful to analysts because they are structured objects containing details of the predicted attacks. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of our approach using a database of real cyberattacks against a US corporation. We show that, relative to a sensors-only baseline, our approach increases accuracy by up to seven percent and doubles the lift of high-confidence predictions.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Link Prediction is an important task for evolutionary analysis of dynamic networks, where the goal is to predict links over time based on sequence of previous graph snapshots. Given a sequence of previous snapshots, we propose a temporal link function, SiameseLSTM, to predict probability of link formation for any pair of nodes in near future. We assume that nodes lie in a temporal latent space, gradually move as the network evolves over time and co-evolve with their neighbors in near future. The proposed model uses LSTM to project the temporal latent space embeddings of nodes to a hidden state latent space optimized for the downstream link prediction task. We use a Siamese adaption of LSTM for the hidden state embeddings to follow Structural Homophily : two nodes which are close to each other in the latent space interact with one another more frequently than two faraway nodes.\n",
      "We empirically show that our model outperforms state of the art algorithms for link prediction when evaluated on real world dynamic networks. We also show how varying number of previous snapshots used to exploit historical information affects the performance of the model to predict future links.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Vertex classification—the problem of identifying the class labels of nodes in a graph—has applicability in a wide variety of domains. Examples include classifying subject areas of papers in citation networks or roles of machines in a computer network. Recent work has demonstrated that vertex classification using graph convolutional networks is susceptible to targeted poisoning attacks, in which both graph structure and node attributes can be changed in an attempt to misclassify a target node. This vulnerability decreases users’ confidence in the learning method and can prevent adoption in high-stakes contexts. This paper presents work in progress aiming to make vertex classification robust to these types of attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "We investigate two aspects of this problem: (1) the classification model and (2) the method for selecting training data. Our alternative classifier is a support vector machine (with a radial basis function kernel), which is applied to an augmented node feature-vector obtained by appending the node’s attributes to a Euclidean vector representing the node based on the graph structure. Our alternative methods of selecting training data are (1) to select the highest-degree nodes in each class and (2) to iteratively select the node with the most neighbors minimally connected to the training set. In the datasets on which the original attack was demonstrated, we show that changing the training set can make the network much harder to attack. To maintain a given probability of attack success, the adversary must use far more perturbations; often a factor of 2–4 over the random training baseline. Even in cases where success is relatively easy for the attacker, we show that the classification and training alternatives allow classification performance to degrade much more gradually, with weaker incorrect predictions for the attacked nodes.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Discovering the interdependent structure among variables plays a key role in knowledge discovery in many real-world applications. Given a sequence of $p$ real-valued variables, the task is to estimate the entire graph structure with $p^2$ pairwise relationships. This problem is computationally challenging since the number of unknown relationships to estimate grows quadratically with respect to the number of variables. In order to solve this problem, many methods have been proposed to cast the structure discovery as an inverse covariance estimation problem by modeling the high dimensional data using a Gaussian graphical model. They focus on how to efficiently estimate the entire precision matrix by developing more advanced optimization algorithms in a sequential manner. A number of methods are also developed to select neighborhood or perform structure learning on categorical data, which are out of this study. A tuning-insensitive approach was proposed to estimate the precision matrix of Gaussian Graphical model in a distributed manner. But it over-parametrized the problem to achieve the tuning-insensitivity. In this study, we proposed a novel framework to discover the underlying graph structure in a distributed manner with a straightforward parametrization. The idea is to decompose the structure discovery task into multiple sub-tasks, such that a column of the precision matrix is estimated in a sub-task. We also proved the distributability and the convexity of the global task. Additionally, we empirically demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework by conducting extensive experiments with comparison to a number of state-of-the-art methods on synthetic datasets. Our case study on a real-world application is also demonstrated to be reliable. The preliminary work we presented here is novel, but it is still in progress as many extensions can be developed based on the proposed distributed framework.\n",

For example, cyclic trading patterns can indicate inefficiencies or economic dependencies in trade networks, cycles in food webs can identify fragile dependencies in ecosystems, and cycles in financial transaction networks can be an indication of money laundering. Identifying such interesting cycles, which can also be constrained to contain a given set of query nodes, although not extensively studied, is thus a problem of considerable importance.\n",

In social networks for example, the probability of a friendship between any pair of people depends on a range of attributes, such as their age, residence location, workplace, and hobbies. The high-level structure of a graph can thus possibly be described well by means of patterns of the form `the subgroup of all individuals with a certain properties X are often (or rarely) friends with individuals in another subgroup defined by properties Y', in comparison to what is expected. Such rules present potentially actionable and generalizable insight into the graph.\n",

Additionally, the interestingness is quantified subjectively, to contrast with prior information an analyst may have about the connectivity. This view immediately enables iterative mining of such patterns.This is the first method aimed at graph connectivity relations between different subgroups. Our method generalizes prior work on dense subgraphs induced by a subgroup description. Although this setting has been studied already, we demonstrate for this special case considerable practical advantages of our subjective interestingness measure with respect to a wide range of (objective) interestingness measures.\n",

However, for real-world graphs with billions of nodes, handling dense node embeddings comes with computational and storage challenges, as embeddings often require space that is orders of magnitude larger than the original graph. In this work, we introduce the problem of latent network summarization that aims to learn a compact, latent representation of the graph structure with dimensionality that is independent of the input graph size (i.e., #nodes and #edges), while retaining the ability to derive node representations on the fly. \n",

Multi-LENS is general and naturally supports both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs with or without directionality, weights, attributes or labels. Extensive experiments on large real graphs show 2 − 89% improvement in AUC for link prediction, while requiring 79−2152× less output storage space than baseline embedding methods.

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Graph embedding is a popular algorithmic approach for creating vector representations for individual vertices in networks. Training these algorithms at scale is important for creating embeddings that can be used for classification, ranking, recommendation and other common applications in industry. While industrial systems exist for training graph embeddings on large datasets, many of these distributed architectures are forced to partition copious amounts of data and model logic across many worker nodes. In this paper, we propose a distributed infrastructure that completely avoids graph partitioning, dynamically creates size constrained computational graphs across worker nodes, and uses highly efficient indexing operations for updating embeddings that allow the system to function at scale. We show that our system can scale to handle the open-source Friendster network (68 million vertices) and on an internal heterogeneous graph (50 million vertices) with a differing number of worker nodes in order to measure performance against two key quantitative metrics: link-prediction accuracy and rate of convergence. We conclude this work by analyzing how a greater number of worker nodes actually improves our system's performance on the aforementioned metrics and discuss our next steps for rigorously evaluating the embedding vectors produced by our system.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Real-world applications often combine learning and optimization problems on graphs. For instance, our objective may be to cluster the graph in order to detect meaningful communities (or solve other common graph optimization problems such as maxcut, vertex cover, and so on). However, graphs or related attributes are often only partially observed, introducing learning problems such as link prediction which must be solved prior to optimization. We propose an approach to integrate a differentiable proxy for common graph optimization problems into training of machine learning models for tasks such as link prediction. This allows the model to focus specifically on the downstream task that its predictions will be used for. Experimental results show that our end-to-end system obtains better performance on example optimization tasks than can be obtained by combining state of the art link prediction methods with expert-designed graph optimization algorithms.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>In this work, we generalize the notion of network motifs (graphlets) to heterogeneous networks by introducing the notion of a small induced typed subgraph called typed graphlet. Typed graphlets generalize graphlets to rich heterogeneous networks as they explicitly capture the higher-order typed connectivity patterns in such networks. To address this problem, we describe a general framework for counting the occurrences of such typed graphlets. The proposed algorithms leverage a number of combinatorial relationships for different typed graphlets. For each edge, we count a few typed graphlets, and with these counts along with the combinatorial relationships, we obtain the exact counts of the other typed graphlets in o(1) constant time. Notably, the worst-case time complexity of the proposed approach matches the best known untyped algorithm. In addition, the approach lends itself to an efficient lock-free and asynchronous parallelization. The experiments confirm the approach is orders of magnitude faster and more space-efficient than existing methods. Unlike existing methods that take hours on small networks, the proposed approach takes only seconds on large networks with millions of edges. This gives rise to new opportunities and applications for typed graphlets on large real-world networks.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Node embedding is the task of extracting informative and descriptive features over the nodes of a graph. The importance of node embedding for graph analytics as well as learning tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection, has led to a growing interest and a number of recent advances. Nonetheless, node embedding faces several major challenges. Practical embedding methods have to deal with real-world graphs that arise from different domains, with inherently diverse underlying processes as well as similarity structures and metrics. On the other hand, similar to principal component analysis in feature vector spaces, node embedding is an inherently unsupervised task. Lacking metadata for validation, practical schemes motivate standardization and limited use of tunable hyperparameters. Finally, node embedding methods must be scalable in order to cope with large-scale real-world graphs of networks with ever-increasing size. The present work puts forth an adaptive node embedding framework that adjusts the embedding process to a given underlying graph, in a fully unsupervised manner. This is achieved by leveraging the notion of a tunable node similarity matrix that assigns weights on multihop paths. The design of multihop similarities ensures that the resultant embeddings also inherit interpretable spectral properties. The proposed model is thoroughly investigated, interpreted, and numerically evaluated using stochastic block models. Moreover, an unsupervised algorithm is developed for training the model parameters effieciently. Extensive node classification, link prediction, and clustering experiments are carried out on many real-world graphs from various domains, along with comparisons with state-of-the-art scalable and unsupervised node embedding alternatives. The proposed method enjoys superior performance in many cases, while also yielding interpretable information on the underlying graph structure.\n",

      "<strong>Abstract:</strong>Most of the existing graph analytics focuses on learning from static rather than dynamic graphs using hand-crafted network features or recently emerged graph embeddings learned independently from a downstream predictive task, solving predictive rather than forecasting tasks directly. To address these limitations, we propose (1) a novel task -- forecasting over dynamic graphs, and (2) a novel deep learning, multi-task, node-aware attention model that focuses on forecasting social interactions, going beyond recently emerged approaches for learning dynamic graph embeddings. Our model relies on graph convolutions and recurrent layers to forecast social interactions in large samples of {\\it real-world dynamic graphs\\footnote{We use the term {\\it graph} in this study, even though it is common to refer to these structures as {\\it social networks}, to avoid any ambiguity with neural network terminology.}} -- Twitter, GitHub, and YouTube up to seven days in advance. Our model can successfully forecast (a) retweets and mentions of a specific news source on Twitter (focusing on deceptive and credible news sources), (b) user-repository interactions on GitHub (focusing on cryptocurrency ecosystems), (c) comments to a specific video on YouTube within the next day with mean absolute error less than 2\\% and $R^2$ exceeding 0.78. We demonstrate that learning from connectivity information over time in combination with node embeddings yields better forecasting results than when we use a two-step approach with Node2Vec and DeepWalk. Moreover, by evaluating model generalizability across three social platforms with different types of interactions we provide novel insights on how the size of the training and forecasting windows, and graph topological properties influence forecasting performance.\n",

That is, our aim is to discover sets of nodes for which the induced subgraph is not only difficult to shatter into disconnected components, but, for which the nodes can also be selected from the entire graph with just a simple conjunctive query on the vertex attributes. As many subgraphs do not have a simple description, first mining robust subgraphs, and then post-hoc discovering their description leads to suboptimal results. Instead, we hence propose to optimise over describable subgraphs only. To do so efficiently, we propose a non-redundant iterative deepening approach, which we equip with a linear-time tight optimistic estimator that allows us to prune large parts of the search space. Through extensive empirical evaluation we show that our method can consider large real-world graphs, and discovers not only easily interpretable but also meaningful subgraphs.\n",
